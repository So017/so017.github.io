							<h3>My Story</h3>
						</header>
						<p style="color: navy;">
							Hi, I'm Sonia! I'm a data analyst. <br>
I've always been curious about different kinds of things—philosophy, coding, and even how to make the best milk foam for coffee. It is satisfying to learn new knowledge. <br><br>

Before my journey into data analytics, I worked in supply chain. Initially, data analysis wasn't expected in my role. One day, I became curious about how shipment performance was impacting sales, what the bestsellers were, etc. I started to organize the data, find insights, and was happy that my teammates found my presentation helpful. I gradually discovered my intuition and passion for data analytics. <br><br>

Due to a change in my life situation, I moved to a new place and took this opportunity to try something I had never done before—running my own coffee shop. It has been such a valuable experience, not just in handling everything on my own, but also in building relationships with customers. <br><br>

At the same time, I kept building my data analytics skills through self-study and projects. I decided that it is a skill that I not only want to maintain but also want to keep mastering and contributing to. <br><br>

Other fun facts about me: I am interested in psychology and understanding different cultures. I am fascinated by people—how they think and why they do what they do. I have been learning Thai and Japanese. I also enjoy photography and mindfulness. Both allow me to slow down, gain clarity, and appreciate the little things in life that often go unnoticed.</p>
